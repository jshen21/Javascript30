## Exercise 6: Ajax Type Ahead

### Key Take-aways:

1. `fetch()` is a global built-in method in the browser to make HTTP requests. It returns a promise. The response is just an HTTP response, and will need to convert it to JSON if the desired file is json file using `.json()` 
2. The Document method `querySelector()` returns the first Element within the document that matches the specified selector, or group of selectors. If no matches are found, `null` is returned.
3. The constructor of the regular expression object—for example, new RegExp('ab+c')—results in runtime compilation of the regular expression. Use the constructor function when you know the regular expression pattern will be changing, or you don't know the pattern and are getting it from another source, such as user input.
4. The <span> tag is much like the <div> element, but <div> is a block-level element and <span> is an inline element. The <span> tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document. The <span> tag is easily styled by CSS or manipulated with JavaScript using the class or id attribute.
